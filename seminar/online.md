# Brandeis University Dynamics and Number Theory Seminar Online Resources

## Information (April 2020 update)
As the seminar has been temporarily suspended, this page provides some online resources to the mathematical community. We gather some links to mathematics online seminars which should be of interest. Topics overlap substantially with the Brandeis Dynamics and Number Theory Seminar.

### Hosts
[Dmitry Kleinbock](http://people.brandeis.edu/~kleinboc/) and [Lam Pham](http://www.lamlaurentpham.com)
