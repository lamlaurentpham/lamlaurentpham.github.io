Linear algebra and calculus.

### Grading scheme

* Homeworks: 20%;
* Midterm exam: 35%;
* Final exam: 45%.

In the event that you perform poorly on the midterm exam, and perform much better on the final exam,
I will adjust the weight of the midterm to 25% and the final exam to 55%.

### Exam schedule

* Midterm: Time and location TBA
* Final exam: determined by registrar

### Topics
enumeration, counting, correspondences, recursion and differential equations, induction,
algebraic structures, networks, algorithms, spectral graph theory

### Homeworks

* Homework 1, due 09/09/2019

### Schedule and Notes

* __Lecture 01 (Aug. 28).__ We defined graphs, subgraphs, morphisms, isomorphisms, the complement of a graph, and saw examples. We proved that $\sum_{x\in V(G)}\mathrm{deg}(x)=2\lvert E(G)\rvert$, and that $\lvert\lbrace x\in V(G)\,\mid\, \mathrm{deg}(x)~\mathrm{is}~\mathrm{odd}\rbrace\rvert$ is even. We defined paths, walks, trails, circuits and cycles, and proved that in any graph with minimal degree $\delta(G)\geq 2$, there exists a cycle of length $\geq \delta(G)+1$.
