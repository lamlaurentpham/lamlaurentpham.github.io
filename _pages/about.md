I am a PhD student in Mathematics at Yale University. I am interested in Lie groups, their discrete subgroups, and arithmetic groups (see Research for more details). My advisers are Professors Gregory Margulis (Yale University) and Emmanuel Breuillard (University of Cambridge). I expect to graduate in Spring 2019.
