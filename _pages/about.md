Since July 2019, I am an Instructor at [Brandeis University](http://www.brandeis.edu/mathematics/). With [Dmitry Kleinbock](http://people.brandeis.edu/~kleinboc/), I co-organize the Dynamics and Number Theory seminar. Click [here](https://lamlaurentpham.github.io/seminar/2019-2020/) for the seminar webpage.

I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from [Yale University](https://math.yale.edu/) in 2019. I am fortunate to have had Professors Gregory Margulis (Yale University) and Emmanuel Breuillard (University of Cambridge) as advisers.

I am primarily interested in Lie groups, their discrete subgroups, algebraic groups, and arithmetic groups; I enjoy learning about their connections to pretty much any other topic (click [here](https://lamlaurentpham.github.io/publications/) for more details).

Previously, I received an M.S. in Computational & Mathematical Engineering at Stanford University (with a short stint in the Mechanical Engineering Department), focusing mostly on probability theory. Even earlier, I received an M.S. in Aerospace Engineering (with a focus on Plasma Physics) and a Diplôme d'Ingénieur at Ecole Centrale Paris, where I studied [Plasma Assisted Combustion](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6012535).

## Books and Translations

I enjoy translating and giving a new breath of life to old French mathematics classics by translating them into English. Click [here](https://lamlaurentpham.github.io/publications/) for more information.
