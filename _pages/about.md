I am currently a PhD student in Mathematics at Yale University, advised by Professors Gregory Margulis (Yale University) and Emmanuel Breuillard (University of Cambridge). I expect to graduate in Spring 2019.

I am primarily interested in Lie groups, their discrete subgroups, and arithmetic groups.

Previously, I completed an M.S. in Computational & Mathematical Engineering at Stanford University, and an M.S. in Aerospace Engineering at Ecole Centrale Paris, where I studied [Plasma Assisted Combustion](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6012535).

## Books and translations

I enjoy translating and giving a new breath of life to old French mathematics classics by translating them into English. If you would like to work together on an old classic, please let me know!

|---|---|---|---|
|_Forthcoming_|1969|Armand Borel|Introduction aux groupes arithmétiques|
|_In Progress_|1965|Armand Borel & Jacques Tits|Groupes réductifs|
