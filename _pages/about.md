I am currently a PhD student in Mathematics at [Yale University](https://math.yale.edu/), advised by Professors Gregory Margulis (Yale University) and Emmanuel Breuillard (University of Cambridge).

I will be a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Brandeis University](http://www.brandeis.edu/mathematics/) starting July 2019.

I am primarily interested in Lie groups, their discrete subgroups, and arithmetic groups.

Previously, I completed an M.S. in Computational & Mathematical Engineering at Stanford University (with a short stint in the Mechanical Engineering Department). Even earlier, I received an M.S. in Aerospace Engineering and a Diplôme d'Ingénieur at Ecole Centrale Paris, where I studied [Plasma Assisted Combustion](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6012535).

## Books and translations

I enjoy translating and giving a new breath of life to old French mathematics classics by translating them into English. If you would like to work together on an old classic, please let me know!
