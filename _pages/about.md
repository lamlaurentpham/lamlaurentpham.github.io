I am an Instructor of Mathematics at [Brandeis University](http://www.brandeis.edu/mathematics/). In the academic year 2020-2021, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the [Einstein Institute of Mathematics of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://mathematics.huji.ac.il/), hosted by [Elon Lindenstrauss](http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~elon/index.html) and supported by a Zuckerman postdoctoral fellowship. I am currently applying for jobs (Fall 2022).

Together with [Dmitry Kleinbock](http://people.brandeis.edu/~kleinboc/), [Han Li](http://li-han.weebly.com/), and [Felipe Ramirez](http://framirez.faculty.wesleyan.edu/), we organize the online [New England Dynamics and Number Theory seminar](https://nednt.wescreates.wesleyan.edu/) which meets on (some) Thursdays 12:15pm-1:15pm.

I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from [Yale University](https://math.yale.edu/) in 2019. I am fortunate to have had Professors Gregory Margulis (Yale University) and Emmanuel Breuillard (University of Cambridge) as advisers.

I am primarily interested in arithmetic groups and their generalizations, with connections to number theory and geometry.

<!---
Previously, I received an M.S. in Computational & Mathematical Engineering at Stanford University (with a short stint in the Mechanical Engineering Department), focusing mostly on probability theory. Even earlier, I received an M.S. in Aerospace Engineering (with a focus on Plasma Physics) and a Diplôme d'Ingénieur at Ecole Centrale Paris, where I studied [Plasma Assisted Combustion](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6012535).

## Books and Translations

<!---
I enjoy translating and giving a new breath of life to old French mathematics classics by translating them into English. Click [here](https://lamlaurentpham.github.io/publications/) for more information.
