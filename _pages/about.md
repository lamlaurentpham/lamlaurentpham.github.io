I am a postdoc at Ghent University, in the Algebra group led by [Tom De Medts](https://algebra.ugent.be/~tdemedts/index.php), and part of the EOS project "High-dimensional expanders and Kac-Moody-Steinberg groups" (in collaboration with Timothée Marquis and Pierre-Emmanuel Caprace from UCLouvain). I am also collaborateur scientifique at the ULB in the cryptography group (department of computer science).

Previously, I was an Instructor in Mathematics at Brandeis University and a Zuckerman postdoctoral fellow at the Einstein Institute of Mathematics of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, hosted by [Elon Lindenstrauss](http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~elon/index.html).

I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from [Yale University](https://math.yale.edu/) in 2019, advised by Gregory Margulis (Yale) and Emmanuel Breuillard (Cambridge).

## Research Interests

Arithmetic groups and algebraic groups, locally symmetric spaces, number theory, harmonic analysis, representation theory, cryptography (lattices and isogenies), quantum computing.

## Other works

I translated A. Borel's 1969 book "Introduction aux groupes arithmétiques" (Hermann-Paris) to English, published by the [AMS](https://bookstore.ams.org/ulect-73) (University Lecture Series 73) in 2019.

## Current Teaching

In Spring 2026, E. Leibtag and I are teaching a course titled "Advanced topics in group theory". The topic is "expansion in finite simple groups of Lie type".
