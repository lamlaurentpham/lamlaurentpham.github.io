I am currently a PhD student in Mathematics at Yale University, advised by Professors Gregory Margulis (Yale University) and Emmanuel Breuillard (University of Cambridge). I am interested in Lie groups, their discrete subgroups, and arithmetic groups ([click here](https://lamlaurentpham.github.io/publications/)) for more details). I expect to graduate in Spring 2019.

## Invited Talks

- University of Cambridge, Discrete analysis seminar, 11/23/2018
- Rutgers University, Number theory seminar, 10/30/2018
- CUNY Graduate Center, New York group theory seminar, 10/26/2018

### Books and translations

I enjoy translating and giving a new breath of life to old French mathematics classics by translating them into english. If you would like to work together on an old classic, please let me know!
