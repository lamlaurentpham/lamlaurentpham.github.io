(2) Locally Commutative Affine Actions on the Plane (2019), _In preparation_
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
We prove a refinement of the strong Tits alternative in the case of affine transformations of the plane. More precisely, we prove that there exists $N\in\mathbb{N}^*$ such that for any finite symmetric subset $S\subset \mathrm{SL}(2,\bar{\mathbb{Q}})\ltimes\bar{\mathbb{Q}}{}^2$ generating a non-virtually solvable subgroup, there exist two words $a$ and $b$ in the generators of $S$ of length less than $N$, generating a non-abelian free group $\mathrm{F}_2$ such that the action $\langle a,b\rangle=\mathrm{F}_2\curvearrowright \bar{\mathbb{Q}}{}^2$ is locally commutative.

(1) Uniform Kazhdan constants and paradoxes of the plane (2018), _Preprint_
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Let $G=\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})\ltimes\mathbb{Z}^2$ and $H=\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$. We prove that the action $G\curvearrowright\mathbb{R}^2$ is uniformly non-amenable and that the quasi-regular representation of $G$ on $\ell^2(G/H)$ has a uniform spectral gap. Both results are a consequence of a uniform quantitative form of ping-pong for affine transformations, which we establish here.
