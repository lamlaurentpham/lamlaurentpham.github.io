  ## 2019. Uniform Kazhdan constants and paradoxes of the plane
  
  Let $G=\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})\ltimes\mathbb{Z}^2$ and $H=\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$. We prove that the action $G\curvearrowright\mathbb{R}^2$ is _uniformly non-amenable_ and that the quasi-regular representation of $G$ on $\ell^2(G/H)$ has a _uniform spectral gap_. Both results are a consequence of a uniform quantitative form of ping-pong for affine transformations, which we establish here.
